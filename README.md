# DijkstraImplementationTwoVariants
Here are two implementations of Dijkstra's shortest path Algorithm, One of them uses decrease key while the other uses stale node. 
Note***:I have used Tushar Roy's Implementation of MinBinary Heap in place of a Priority Queue for efficiency purposes.
To run the program, you need to download Processing and hit the run button. I have added a test image and chosen an arbritrary
destination node to show the path.
